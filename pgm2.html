<h1>LISTS IN HTML</h1><br>
<h2>ORDERED LIST</h2>
<p>An ordered list in HTML is used to display a list of items in a specific, numbered order. It is created using the 'ol' tag, and each list item is defined with the 'li' tag. Ordered lists are useful when the order of items matters, such as in instructions, rankings, or steps in a process. By default, the browser numbers each item starting from 1, but this can be customized using attributes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Decimal (Numbers)</li>
<li>Uppercase Letters</li>
<li>Lowercase Letters</li>
<li>Uppercase Roman Numerals</li>
<li>Lowercase Roman Numerals</li>
</ol>
<h2>UNORDERED LIST</h2>
<p>An unordered list in HTML is used to group a set of related items in no specific order. It is created using the 'ul' tag, and each item in the list is defined with the 'li' (list item) tag. Unlike ordered lists, unordered lists do not use numbers. Instead, they use bullets (‚óè) or other markers like circles or squares, depending on the browser or list style. Unordered lists are commonly used for things like menus, features, shopping lists, or any content where the order of items doesn't matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disc</li>
<li>Circle</li>
<li>Square</li>
<li>None</li>
</ul>
<h2>DEFINITION LIST</h2>
<p>A definition list in HTML is used to display terms and their corresponding descriptions, making it ideal for glossaries, dictionaries, or any content that requires a term-definition format. It consists of three main tags: 'dl' for the definition list container, 'dt' for each term (definition term), and 'dd' for the description (definition description). Unlike ordered or unordered lists, a definition list does not use bullets or numbers. Instead, it pairs each term with its explanation in a structured and readable way. This type of list is especially useful for presenting information clearly and semantically in educational or reference content.</p>
Example:-
<dl>
  <dt>HTML-</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language, used to structure content on the web.</dd>

  <dt>CSS-</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets, used to style and layout web pages.</dd>

  <dt>JavaScript-</dt>
  <dd>A programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</dd>
