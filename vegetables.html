<p>Vegetables are an essential part of a balanced diet and are valued for their high nutritional content and health benefits. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, which help protect the body from chronic diseases and support overall well-being. Vegetables come in many varieties, including leafy greens, root vegetables, legumes, and gourds, each offering unique flavors and nutrients. Regular consumption of vegetables promotes good digestion, strengthens the immune system, lowers the risk of heart disease, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Whether eaten raw in salads, steamed, stir-fried, or added to soups and curries, vegetables add color, texture, and vitality to every meal.</p>
